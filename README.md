# AE-RenamerTool

Renaming composition are the worst amiright? ;)
Well good for you because the new comp renamer is out.



You will be able to **rename a batch of composition at the same time**.
> For example, having all the compositions named : "Disney", if it's your thing

But also you can **add to the name the resolution** of the composition.
> For example you will automatically have some "Disney_1920x1080" and "Disney_800x800" and "Disney_1080x1920"

And even **have versions, by defining key items** - composition, images, video.
> For example Elsa.jpg will define the Frozen version, and Simba.mov will define the LionKing version, you will have at the end :
  > - _"Disney_Frozen_1920x1080"_
  > - _"Disney_Frozen_800x800"_
  > - _"Disney_Frozen_1080x1920"_
  > - _"Disney_LionKing_1920x1080"_
  > - _"Disney_LionKing_800x800"_
  > - _"Disney_LionKing_1080x1920"_
